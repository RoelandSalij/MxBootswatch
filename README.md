MxBootswatch
==========

MxBootswatch is a collection of free themes for Mendix using the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework. These themes are based on the themes provided by Bootswatch. Check it out at [bootswatch.com](http://bootswatch.com).

Usage
-----
Download the `bootstrap.min.css` file associated with a theme and replace Bootstrap's default stylesheet.




Customization
------
MxBootswatch is open source and youâ€™re welcome to modify the themes.

Each theme consists of two LESS files. `variables.less`, which is included by default in Bootstrap, allows you to customize [these settings](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/#less-variables). `bootswatch.less` introduces more extensive structural changes.

Check out the [Help page](http://bootswatch.com/help/) for more details on building your own theme.

API
-----

A simple API is available for integrating your platform with Mendix and Bootswatch.

Included in this project is a Grunt.js file which enables you to easily combile your less files and create the appropriate zip files for you themes.

To build a theme using grunt simply type:
`grunt swatch : themename`

Alternatively you can build all the themes using the command swatch.

The swatch objects are returned in an array called `themes`, each one with the following properties:  `name`, `description`, `preview`, `thumbnail`, `css`, `cssMin`, `less`, and `lessVariables`.
